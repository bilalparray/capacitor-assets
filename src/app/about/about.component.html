    <!-- How It Works -->
    <h2>How Does the Capacitor App Icon and Splash Screen Generator Work?</h2>
    <p>
      It’s simple to generate high-quality app icons and splash screens using our tool. Here’s how it works:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Upload your base image</strong>: Start by uploading your logo or any image
        you'd
        like to use as your app icon.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Preview the uploaded image</strong>: After uploading, you’ll see a preview of
        how
        your image looks. Make sure it meets your design standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Generate Icons & Splash Screens</strong>: After you’re happy with the image
        preview, simply click "Generate Assets" to create the icons and splash screens in all the required sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>Download your files</strong>: Once the files are ready, download them
        individually
        or as a ZIP package to use in your app development.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- What Assets Are Generated -->
    <h2>What Assets Are Generated?</h2>
    <p>
      Upon uploading your app logo, our tool automatically generates the following assets in their respective sizes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>icon-only.png:</strong> 1024x1024 - A standalone app icon without background.</li>
      <li><strong>icon-foreground.png:</strong> 1024x1024 - The foreground layer for adaptive icons.</li>
      <li><strong>splash.png:</strong> 2732x2732 - The primary splash screen for your app (light mode).</li>
      <li><strong>splash-dark.png:</strong> 2732x2732 - The splash screen for dark mode.</li>
      <li><strong>icon-background.png:</strong> 1024x1024 - The background layer for adaptive icons.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- File Sizes -->
    <h2>File Sizes and Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      The images generated follow the recommended sizes for Android and iOS. Here are the important file sizes and their
      respective platforms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Android:</strong> Android requires adaptive icons, which consist of a background and a foreground
        layer.
        The recommended size for these icons is 1024x1024 pixels, which our tool generates for you.</li>
      <li><strong>iOS:</strong> iOS uses static icons for your app, and we generate sizes like 1024x1024 for the App
        Store
        icon. We also ensure that your splash screens meet the required iOS screen resolutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Capacitor Apps:</strong> Capacitor apps need both icons and splash screens to be added to the native
        app
        project. Our generator provides all the required assets in the correct sizes to easily integrate with your
        Capacitor project.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Best Practices for App Icon Design -->
    <h2>Best Practices for App Icon Design</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure your app icons and splash screens look professional and are highly visible on all devices, follow these
      best practices:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> A simple design makes your app icon more recognizable and professional. Avoid
        using
        too many details that may be hard to see on small screens.</li>
      <li><strong>High-Resolution:</strong> Use a high-resolution image for your base logo to ensure it looks crisp and
        clear
        on all screen sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparent Background:</strong> For your app icon, it’s best to have a transparent background to
        create
        a clean and modern look. This also allows the icon to blend seamlessly with the device's theme.</li>
      <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Use contrasting colors between the foreground and background to ensure that the
        icon
        is
        easily visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Always test your app icons on different devices to ensure they appear as expected,
        especially
        on devices with varying screen sizes.</li>
    </ul>
