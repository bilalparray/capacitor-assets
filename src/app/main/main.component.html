      <!-- How It Works -->
      <h2>How Does the Capacitor App Icon and Splash Screen Generator Work?</h2>
      <p>
        It’s simple to generate high-quality app icons and splash screens using our tool. Here’s how it works:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Upload your base image</strong>: Start by uploading your logo or any image
          you'd
          like to use as your app icon.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Preview the uploaded image</strong>: After uploading, you’ll see a preview of
          how
          your image looks. Make sure it meets your design standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Generate Icons & Splash Screens</strong>: After you’re happy with the image
          preview, simply click "Generate Assets" to create the icons and splash screens in all the required sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>Download your files</strong>: Once the files are ready, download them
          individually
          or as a ZIP package to use in your app development.</li>
      </ol>
  
      <!-- What Assets Are Generated -->
      <h2>What Assets Are Generated?</h2>
      <p>
        Upon uploading your app logo, our tool automatically generates the following assets in their respective sizes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>icon-only.png:</strong> 1024x1024 - A standalone app icon without background.</li>
        <li><strong>icon-foreground.png:</strong> 1024x1024 - The foreground layer for adaptive icons.</li>
        <li><strong>splash.png:</strong> 2732x2732 - The primary splash screen for your app (light mode).</li>
        <li><strong>splash-dark.png:</strong> 2732x2732 - The splash screen for dark mode.</li>
        <li><strong>icon-background.png:</strong> 1024x1024 - The background layer for adaptive icons.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <!-- File Sizes -->
      <h2>File Sizes and Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        The images generated follow the recommended sizes for Android and iOS. Here are the important file sizes and their
        respective platforms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Android requires adaptive icons, which consist of a background and a foreground
          layer.
          The recommended size for these icons is 1024x1024 pixels, which our tool generates for you.</li>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> iOS uses static icons for your app, and we generate sizes like 1024x1024 for the App
          Store
          icon. We also ensure that your splash screens meet the required iOS screen resolutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Capacitor Apps:</strong> Capacitor apps need both icons and splash screens to be added to the native
          app
          project. Our generator provides all the required assets in the correct sizes to easily integrate with your
          Capacitor project.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <!-- Best Practices for App Icon Design -->
      <h2>Best Practices for App Icon Design</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure your app icons and splash screens look professional and are highly visible on all devices, follow these
        best practices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> A simple design makes your app icon more recognizable and professional. Avoid
          using
          too many details that may be hard to see on small screens.</li>
        <li><strong>High-Resolution:</strong> Use a high-resolution image for your base logo to ensure it looks crisp and
          clear
          on all screen sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent Background:</strong> For your app icon, it’s best to have a transparent background to
          create
          a clean and modern look. This also allows the icon to blend seamlessly with the device's theme.</li>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Use contrasting colors between the foreground and background to ensure that the
          icon
          is
          easily visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Always test your app icons on different devices to ensure they appear as expected,
          especially
          on devices with varying screen sizes.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- FAQs -->
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
  
      <h3>1. What image formats are supported?</h3>
      <p>We support PNG, JPG, and other common image formats for uploading your app logo.</p>
  
      <h3>2. What is the maximum file size for uploads?</h3>
      <p>You can upload images up to 10MB for best results. Larger files may result in slower processing times.</p>

      <p>The tool will automatically crop your image into a square to ensure that your icon is the right aspect ratio.
        However, it’s best to upload a square image to begin with for optimal results.</p>
  
      <h3>4. Can I use this tool for non-Capacitor apps?</h3>
      <p>Yes, you can use the generated icons and splash screens for other mobile platforms like Android and iOS, but it
        is
        designed specifically for Capacitor apps.</p>
  
      <h3>5. Can I download the icons in a different format?</h3>
      <p>Currently, the generator provides PNG files, as this is the most widely supported format for app icons and splash
        screens.</p>
  
      <h3>6. How do I integrate these assets into my Capacitor project?</h3>
      <p>Once you have downloaded your assets, you can integrate them into your Capacitor project by placing them in the
        appropriate directories. Our tool ensures the sizes and formats are already aligned with Capacitor's requirements,
        making integration a breeze.</p>
